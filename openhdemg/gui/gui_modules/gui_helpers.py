class GUIHelpers:
    """
    A utility class to provide additional functionalities in an openhdemg GUI application.

    This class includes helper functions to enhance user interaction with the application, 
    such as resizing files based on user input. It is designed to work in conjunction with 
    the main GUI components and relies on the parent widget for accessing shared data and resources.

    Attributes
    ----------
    parent : object
        The parent widget, typically the main application window, to which this GUIHelpers 
        instance belongs.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(self, parent)
        Initialize a new instance of the GUIHelpers class.
    resize_file(self)
        Resize the EMG file based on user-defined areas selected in the GUI plot.
    export_to_excel(self)
        Save an analaysis dataframe to a csv file. 
    sort_mus(self)
        Sort motor units according to recriuitement order.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> main_window = Tk()
    >>> gui_helpers = GUIHelpers(main_window)
    # Usage of gui_helpers methods as required

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        When no file is loaded prior to analysis or certain operations are attempted 
        without the necessary context or data.

    Notes
    -----
    The class's methods interact with other components of the openhdemg application, 
    such as file handling and plotting utilities, and are dependent on the state of the 
    parent widget.

    def __init__(self, parent):

        Initialize a new instance of the GUIHelpers class.

        Sets up a reference to the parent widget, which is used for accessing shared

        ----------
        parent : object
            The parent widget, usually the main application window, which provides
