A roadmap is a collection of planned **milestones** and **tasks** that are necessary for the successful development and growth of the *openhdemg* project. It outlines the key steps and objectives that need to be achieved to meet the project's goals and deliver value to the community. The roadmap drives the project's evolution, ensuring that efforts are focused, organized, and aligned with the overall vision.

Milestones represent significant achievements and tasks are the actionable steps to reach those milestones. They provide a structured approach to project planning and execution, tracking progress and ensuring systematic completion. The roadmap is flexible, allowing us to incorporate users feedback and refine the plan based on community input.

## Milestones

Legend for milestones status:

:fontawesome-solid-check: &nbsp; Completed

:fontawesome-solid-clock: &nbsp; Ongoing 

:fontawesome-solid-calendar-day: &nbsp; Planned date

At this stage, we have identified and set six major milestones for the *openhdemg* project. These milestones are divided into two categories: three on the development side and three on the engagement side.

--------------------------------------------

### Development milestones

The development milestones focus on advancing the framework's functionality, improving existing features, and introducing new algorithms and analysis techniques. These milestones aim to enhance the capabilities and performance of *openhdemg*, providing a more powerful and comprehensive tool for analyzing High-Density Electromyography (HD-EMG) recordings.

**Going public** &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-check:

On 04/07/2023 the *openhdemg* project was released to the public with a beta release on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/openhdemg/){:target="_blank"}, a public [GitHub](https://github.com/GiacomoValliPhD/openhdemg){:target="_blank"} repository, a website and a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openhdemg){:target="_blank"} page. This milestone marks the beginning of *openhdemg* as an open-source project.

**Stable release v0.1** &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-clock: &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-calendar-day:

Planned by end of 2023. While a beta release is meant for testing purpose, a stable release represents the transition to a production-ready version of the framework. The primary objective of this milestone is to ensure the reliability, robustness, and usability of *openhdemg* for a wide range of users.

**Release v1.0** &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-clock:

The release of Version 1.0 is undoubtedly the most significant achievement for an open-source project like *openhdemg*, signifying a substantial enhancement in the project's completeness and usability. With this release, the project has achieved a level of maturity that fulfills the needs of a wide range of users in the field of HD-EMG.

--------------------------------------------

### Engagement milestones

On the engagement side, the milestones aim to enhance the reach and outreach of *openhdemg* and to bring new [contributors](#meet-the-contributors) in the project. These milestones focus on expanding the visibility and impact of *openhdemg* within the HD-EMG community and beyond.

**Reach 1** &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-clock: &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-calendar-day:

Planned by end of 2023. By leveraging preferred channels such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openhdemg){:target="_blank"} and congresses, we aim to engage with new individuals and organizations interested in HD-EMG analysis. Target to complete 'Reach 1' = 100 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/openhdemg){:target="_blank"} followers.

**Outreach 1** &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-clock: &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-calendar-day:

Planned by end of 2023. This milestone involves improving documentation, providing tutorials and educational resources, and enhancing user support. By achieving these milestones, we aim to empower users with the knowledge and tools they need to effectively utilize *openhdemg* and conduct their own HD-EMG analyses. Target to complete 'Outreach 1' = cover all the functionalities of the *openhdemg* framework with specific tutorials.

**Increase contributors 1** &nbsp; :fontawesome-solid-clock:

Bringing new contributors to the *openhdemg* project is fundamental to increase the functionalities of the framework and to build a collaborative community of experts. Target to complete 'Increase contributors 1' = 5 external contributors
