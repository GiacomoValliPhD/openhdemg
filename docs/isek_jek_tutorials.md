## 2024 ISEK Workshop

**Workshop: Simplified analysis of motor unit properties with *openhdemg*.**

On the 26th of June 2024, we will present the *openhdemg* framework at the [ISEK congress](https://isek.org/workshops/){:target="_blank"}, which will be held in Nagoya, Japan.

Below, you can find a preliminary design of the workshop and the fantastic speakers who will participate. We look forward to seeing you there!

More info will come soon.
