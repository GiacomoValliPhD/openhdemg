## Mission

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 10px;">
<em>
“To build the most complete, easy-to-use, free, and open-source framework for the analysis of High-Density Electromyography (HD-EMG) recordings”
</em>
</div>

<br>
But we cannot achieve this alone! That's why *openhdemg* is a community-driven project where everyone's [contribution](contribute.md) is welcomed and essential.

## Goals

:octicons-hash-24: community :octicons-hash-24: inclusion :octicons-hash-24: collaboration :octicons-hash-24: knowledgesharing

We aim to cultivate a culture of knowledge sharing, collaboration, and open-source contributions within the HD-EMG community, ensuring that expertise and advancements are accessible to all.

:octicons-hash-24: advance :octicons-hash-24: discover :octicons-hash-24: research

We want to empower researchers with an efficient, effective and comprehensive framework for the analysis of HD-EMG recordings and single motor unit properties to advance their research.

## Roadmap

A roadmap is a collection of planned **milestones** and **tasks** that are necessary for the successful development and growth of the *openhdemg* project. It outlines the key steps and objectives that need to be achieved to meet the project's goals and deliver value to the community. The roadmap drives the project's evolution, ensuring that efforts are focused, organized, and aligned with the overall vision.

At this stage, we have identified and set six major milestones for the *openhdemg* project. These milestones are divided into two categories: three on the development side and three on the engagement side.

## Meet the developers

Giacomo Valli:

- giacomo.valli@phd.unipd.it

- The creator of the project and the developer of the library.
    
- Giacomo Valli obtained a master degree in Sports Science and a research fellowship in molecular biology of exercise at the University of Urbino (IT). He is currently a PhD student at the University of Padova (IT) in neuromuscular physiology. He is investigating the electrophysiological modifications happening during disuse, disease and aging and linking this information to the molecular alterations of the muscle.

Paul Ritsche:

- paul.ritsche@unibas.ch

- The developer of the GUI.

- Paul Ritsche obtained a master degree in Sports Science at the University of Basel (CH). He is currently a research associate at the University of Basel (CH) focusing on muscle ultrasonography. He is investigating automatic ultrasonography image analysis methods to evaluate muscle morphological as well architectural parameters.
