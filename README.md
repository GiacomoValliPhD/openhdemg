# openhdemg
A powerful toolbox for the analysis of HD-EMG recordings.

## What and why?

The openhdemg project was born in 2022 with the aim to provide a free 
and open-source framework to analyse HIGH-DENSITY EMG recordings.

The field of EMG analysis in humans has always be characterised by little
or no software available for signal post-processing an analysis and this 
forced users to code their own scripts. 
Although coding can be funny, it can lead to a number of problems,
especially when the utilised scripts are not shared open-source.
Why?

- If different users use different scripts, the results can differ.
- Any code can contain errors, if the code is not shared, the error
    will never be known and it will repeat in the following analysis.
- There is a huge difference between the paper methods and the
    practical implementation of a script. It will never be possible
    to reproduce a script solely based on words (thus making the 
    reproducibility of a study unrealistic).
- Anyone who doesn't code, will not be able to analyse the recordings.

In order to overcome these (and many other) problems of private
scripts, we developed a fully transparent framework with appropriate
documentation to allow all the users to check the correctness of the 
script and to perform reproducible analysis.

This project is aimed at users that already know the Python language,
for those willing to learn it and even for those not interested in coding
thanks to a friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

Both the openhdemg project and its contributors adhere to the
Open Science Principles and especially to the idea of public release 
of data and other scientific resources necessary to conduct honest research.
